#  Kraaken üêô: Containerized Deployment  üê≥

Kraaken, provides a series of docker commands to orchestrate your containerized applications' deployment! It is nothing more than scripts which would normally have to be done by hand to automate things like:

*   Cloudflare tunneling
*   Hetzner server provisioning
*   Traefik configuration
*   1Password secret management sync with environment variables

## Requirements

*   [1Password CLI ]("https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#install") (Managing Secrets)
*   [BuildJet Github Addon ]("https://github.com/marketplace/buildjet") (Deployment with ARM)

## Example Deployment Workflow

*   A jump host stands between the local developer environment and the server.

## Installation

Add Kraaken to your Gemfile:


```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'kraaken'
end
```

Then, run the following command to install the gem:

```zsh
bundle install
```

## Usage

Kraaken provides several commands to streamline your containerized deployment process:

### Commands

*   `kraaken app credentials`:  Opens the credentials file, reads the `.env` file from the server.
*   `kraaken app deploy`: Deploys the app, Creates a directory and `.env` file, copies `docker-compose.yml` to the server, pulls from the registry, and starts up the container.
*   `kraaken app destroy`: Destroys the app, closes the docker container along with volumes.
*   `kraaken app logs`: Shows the logs of the app, follows logs of the container.

*   `kraaken ssh config` Updates the local ssh config file

*   `kraaken server provision <app-name>` Provision a new server
*   `kraaken server list ` Lists all current servers

## Questions
### How do I get access to the network?
SSH keys can be managed via cloud_config file.

### Why is there no load balancer?
We utilize cloudflare handles this for us via proxied domain.
